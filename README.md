# TOURISM-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The project aimed to develop a website where customers can get the information about tourist destinations, hotels, and transportation for their upcoming trips before going on their journey. This website is entirely managed from the administrative end, allowing only the administrator to add new tourist places, hotels, transportation, manage all bookings, and oversee the customer and admin database. This website is built using Python, Django framework, HTML, CSS, and SQLite database. This website homepage features a login and registration interface where new users can create accounts or existing users can log in. Once logged in, users are directed to the tourist packages section. Here, users can browse and select destinations, hotels, and transportation for booking packages. They can proceed to make payments securely through the website. Users are provided with the flexibility to cancel bookings if needed, and the system supports refund processing accordingly. All user and administrative data are stored in tables within an SQLite database. After completing the booking process, users will receive a confirmation regarding their tour. This confirmation typically includes essential details such as: Booking Information, Booking Dates, Payment Details, Contact Information, Cancellation and Refund Policies.
